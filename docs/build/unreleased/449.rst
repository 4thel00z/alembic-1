    Reworked "sourceless" system to be fully capable of handling any
    combination of: Python2/3x, pep3149 or not, PYTHONOPTIMIZE or not,
    for locating and loading both env.py files as well as versioning files.
    This includes: locating files inside of ``__pycache__`` as well as listing
    out version files that might be only in ``versions/__pycache__``, deduplicating
    version files that may be in ``versions/__pycache__`` and ``versions/``
    at the same time, correctly looking for .pyc or .pyo files based on
    if pep488 is present or not. The latest Python3x deprecation warnings
    involving importlib are also corrected.
