    :tags: bug, postgresql, autogenerate
    :tickets: 461

    Fixed bug where autogenerate would produce a DROP statement for the index
    implicitly created by a Postgresql EXCLUDE constraint, rather than skipping
    it as is the case for indexes implicitly generated by unique constraints.
    Makes use of SQLAlchemy 1.0.x's improved "duplicates index" metadata and
    requires at least SQLAlchemy version 1.0.x to function correctly.
