   Fixed bug introduced in release 0.9.0 where the helptext for commands
   inadvertently got expanded to include function docstrings from the
   command.py module.  The logic has been adjusted to only refer to the first
   line(s) preceding the first line break within each docstring, as was the
   original intent.
