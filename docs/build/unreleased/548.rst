   Simplified the internal scheme used to generate the ``alembic.op`` namespace
   to no longer attempt to generate full method signatures (e.g. rather than
   generic ``*args, **kw``) as this was not working in most cases anyway, while
   in rare circumstances it would in fact sporadically have access to the real
   argument names and then fail when generating the function due to missing
   symbols in the argument signature.
