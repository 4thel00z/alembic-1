    A :class:`.ForeignKeyConstraint` can now render correctly if the
    ``link_to_name`` flag is set, as it will not attempt to resolve the name
    from a "key" in this case.  Additionally, the constraint will render
    as-is even if the remote column name isn't present on the referenced
    remote table.
